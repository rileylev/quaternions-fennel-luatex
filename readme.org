#+title: Readme

I want to use quaternions in my [[https://tikz.dev/][TikZ]] pictures, but I don't want to teach TeX what a quaternion is.
So I can use [[https://www.luatex.org/][LuaTeX]]'s ~\directlua~. Because I already have some clojure code for drawing, I want to use
[[https://fennel-lang.org/][Fennel]], in the hope that eventually I can use a common subset of Clojure and Fennel for drawing diagrams in TikZ or in the browser.
